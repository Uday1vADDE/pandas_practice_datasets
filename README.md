# pandas_practice_datasets

This repository contains my **Pandas practice notebooks**, where I worked on various Kaggle datasets to strengthen my understanding of **data handling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis**.

The notebooks demonstrate the **step-by-step workflow** for working with real-world data, including:  

- **Inspecting datasets** (shape, columns, data types)  
- **Handling missing values and duplicates**  
- Performing basic **data transformations** and **type conversions**  
- Identifying **outliers** using statistical and visualization techniques  
- Generating **observations and insights** from the data  

Each notebook includes **detailed Markdown explanations** describing the concepts applied, why they were used, and how they help in real-world data analysis. This makes it easier to **recall the workflow** and the reasoning behind each step.

**Purpose:**  

This repository serves as a **reference for revisiting Pandas concepts** and practicing **data manipulation techniques**, preparing for **data analysis and data science projects**.
